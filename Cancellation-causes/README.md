# **Cancellation causes **
> The company discovered that most of its customers are inactive. To improve, it wants to understand the reasons for cancellations and the effective actions to reduce this number. The project involves analyzing a customer database, cleaning it, and identifying correlations between variables and cancellations. By solving three identified problems, the cancellation rate dropped from 56% to 18%.

## **About the Project**
> The company identified that most of its active customers had become inactive, which prompted a project aimed at reducing cancellation rates. The project consisted of analyzing a customer database, which contained information such as age, gender, plan, length of time as a customer, number of calls to the call center, among others. First, the dataset was loaded, and null and/or irrelevant values ​​were identified and cleaned. Then, it was calculated how many customers canceled their services. Understanding the severity of the situation, all variables were compared with cancellations to identify correlations. For example, it was discovered that customers who received more than five calls from the call center were more likely to cancel their services. After identifying the problems, simulations were performed to predict the results of corrective actions. By solving just three problems, the cancellation rate dropped from 56% to 18%.

## **Data Overview**
> The .CSV database contains 881,666 rows, with columns providing customer demographic and behavioral information. Data includes age, gender, plan type, length of customer service, and number of calls to the call center. The analysis of the database focused on understanding customer churn patterns and identifying variables that influence these rates.

## **Results and Insights**
> The results of the analysis were quite significant. Initially, the company was facing a high churn rate of 56%. After a detailed analysis, it was identified that factors such as excessive call center calls were negatively influencing customer retention. By implementing corrective actions based on the correlations found, there was an impressive reduction in the churn rate, which dropped to 18%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the measures adopted and the importance of using data to guide customer retention strategies. The analysis also revealed valuable insights into customer behavior, allowing the company to adjust its approaches and significantly improve its results.
